Measuring impact and updating AI model for a telecommunication or communication service provider (CSP) industry.

I developed a business proposal which higlights the several important aspects of the product development.

The proposal split into ->

Business goal - Description of the product and what value it brings to the business.

Sucess Metrics - Added measurable, predictive, comparable metrics for business sucess.

Data - Whether buying or collecting data is important, data sensitivity, cost.

Model - Which ML techinque would be useful and why.

MVP - How the product look like ? who uses it, and how do they use it?
